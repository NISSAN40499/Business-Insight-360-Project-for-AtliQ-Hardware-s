### **Project initial Emails**  

The **Business Insight 360** project officially commenced with an initial meeting. **Nick Puri**, the **Product Owner and primary stakeholder**, initiated the process by sending an email. Given the CEO’s strong interest in the project, Nick attached a **feature specification Excel file**, detailing the key report features—each designed to address specific business questions and challenges.  

In response, the **Director of Data Analytics** formed a dedicated team for the project and forwarded an email to **Tony Sharma**, a **Senior Data Analyst at AtliQ Hardwares**, instructing him to schedule a kick-off meeting with Nick Puri.  

To facilitate the process, Tony sent an official email to Nick to arrange the project initiation meeting. Before the meeting, Tony **established a project team**, including **Jr. Data Analyst Maynul Hassan Nissan (me)**, and created a **Project Charter**, outlining the project's scope, objectives, and deliverables.

### **Project Kick-off Meeting Summary**

During the **kick-off meeting**, all the features outlined in the **Excel file** were discussed. The key views identified for the project were **Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, **Supply**, and **Executive View**.  

**Tony** raised several project-related questions to **Nick** to clarify project scope and resources. A significant point of discussion was the **reliability data** required for the **Supply Chain View**. Tony mentioned that this data was currently unavailable. He further shared that he had spoken with the **Data Engineers** about obtaining this data, to which the engineers replied that it would take approximately **4-6 weeks** to gather.
