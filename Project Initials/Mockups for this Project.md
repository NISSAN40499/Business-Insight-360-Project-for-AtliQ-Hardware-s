## **Mockup Design for Report Views**  

In business intelligence projects, product owners and key stakeholders often communicate their requirements through rough sketches or direct discussions. In our case, **Nick Puri**, the product owner and main stakeholder, provided an initial mockup via **Microsoft Teams**, outlining his expectations for the report views. His sketches specified the placement of various visual elements, including graphs and key performance indicators (KPIs).

On the Nick Puri's Mockup, He had mentioned 4 views, and his expectations for those views. 

### **Report View Breakdown**  

#### **Finance View:**  
- **P&L Structure Report**: Displays gross sales to GM% in rows, with **year** and **YoY%** in columns.  
- **Performance Over Time (Line Chart)**: Compares the selected year vs. the previous year, segmented by month.  
- **Top & Bottom Market Matrix**: Showcases **Net Sales (NS)** and **YoY%** in columns.  

#### **Sales View:**  
- **Top Customers (Matrix Format)**: Displays **Net Sales (NS)** with **year** and **YoY%** in columns.  
- **Scatter Chart**: Plots **GM% vs. NS%** to identify trends.  
- **Pie Chart**: Represents category-wise distribution.  
- **Top Products (Matrix Format)**: Displays **year-wise** sales performance with **YoY%**.  

#### **Marketing View:**  
- **Top Products by Division (Matrix Format)**: Displays **year-wise** performance with **YoY%**.  
- **Scatter Chart**: Plots **GM% vs. NS%**.  
- **Unit Economics (Pie Chart)**: Visualizes cost breakdown.  
- **Top Market (Matrix Format)**: Displays **year-wise** performance with **YoY%**.  

#### **Supply View:**  
- **KPIs**: **Forecast Accuracy (FA)**, **Net Error (NE)**.  
- **Accuracy Over Time Chart**: **FA vs. FA Last Year (LY)** comparison.  
- **Top & Bottom Customers (Matrix Format)**: Shows accuracy performance.  
- **Top & Bottom Products (Matrix Format)**: Displays product-level forecast accuracy.  

üìå **Limitations:**  
For **FY 2022**, we only have data up to **December 31**. Beyond that, only forecast data is available. To address this, **landing estimates**, **Year-to-Date (YTD)**, and **Year-to-Go (YTG)** values need to be calculated.

### **Why Mockups Are Essential?**  
Mockups serve as a **visual communication tool**, allowing stakeholders to preview the design and provide early feedback. They help in:  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enhancing user experience** by structuring reports logically.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Reducing miscommunication** between developers and stakeholders.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Speeding up the design approval process**, ensuring alignment before implementation.  

### **Mockup Preparation Approach**  
To optimize usability:  
üîπ Visuals were positioned strategically, following a **Z-shaped reading pattern** to enhance readability.  
üîπ **Balance and spacing** were maintained to ensure clarity.  
üîπ Consistent formatting was applied for a **professional, structured layout**.

### **Mockup Delivery Options**  
For delivering mockups, options include:  
üìù **Hand-drawn sketches** for quick iteration.  
üé® **PowerPoint** for a structured, corporate look.  
üñ•Ô∏è **AI-powered design tools** for precision and efficiency.  

For this project, I used **Mockup AI**, an advanced **AI-driven design tool**, to create a **polished version of the mockup**.
