## **AtliQ Hardware – Business Model & Problem Statement**  

#### **Business Model Overview**  
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing electronics company specializing in PCs, laptops, and peripherals such as mice and keyboards. Similar to Dell or HP, AtliQ sells its products through a diverse network of customers, including major retail chains and e-commerce platforms.  

The company follows a structured supply chain:  
1. **Manufacturing:** Products are built in AtliQ’s factories.  
2. **Warehousing:** Goods are stored in inventory warehouses.  
3. **Distribution:** Products are shipped globally to various customers, including:  
   - **Retailers (Brick & Mortar & E-commerce):** Stores like Best Buy, Staples, Croma, and Flipkart, which sell directly to consumers.  
   - **AtliQ Exclusive Stores:** AtliQ’s own retail outlets and e-commerce platform, similar to Dell and HP’s direct sales model.  
   - **Distributors:** Partners that facilitate sales in markets where AtliQ lacks direct operations, such as China and South Korea.  

#### **The Business Challenge**  
As AtliQ expands globally, it faces new challenges. A significant setback occurred when the company entered the Latin American market, resulting in financial losses. Initial assessments suggested that these losses stemmed from decisions based on intuition and limited market research rather than data-driven insights.  

Meanwhile, AtliQ’s competitors, including Dell and HP, leverage large, highly skilled Data Analytics (DA) teams to optimize business operations and gain a competitive edge. Recognizing the need to strengthen its data-driven decision-making capabilities, AtliQ has established an internal Data Analytics team.  
The newly formed DA team is tasked with creating comprehensive analytics and reporting solutions across key business functions. By leveraging data analytics, AtliQ aims to enhance transparency, improve decision-making accuracy, and compete more effectively in the electronics market.
