### **Importing Data into SQL Workbench**

1. I received two `.sql.gz` files: **gdb041** and **gdb056**.
2. Moved them to the **C:\dump** folder and uncompressed using **WinRAR**.
3. In **MySQL Workbench**, connected to **localhost**.
4. Imported each `.sql` file via **Server > Data Import** by selecting **Import from Self-Contained File** and browsing the files from **C:\dump**.
5. Verified the import by checking the tables in MySQL Workbench.
